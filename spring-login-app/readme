Login spring boot application

The app gives the opportunity of signing in and out on localhost, on the 8080 port with the following credentials:
username "user" and password "password". If these credentials are put, the user will be redirected from the
"/login" page to the "/logged" page, where he/she is greeted with "Hello user!" and from where the user can sign out and
be redirected to the "/login" page.

I have tested with mockMvc the fact that the user can authenticate with the credentials mentioned before and cannot
authenticate with any other credentials.

If you consider this project as not enough, please let me know. For example, if a user should sign in with any data,
I will use a JPA Repository and connect to a database in order to put all the data for a client in a predefined
structure.
